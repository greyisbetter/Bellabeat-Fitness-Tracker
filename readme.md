## Business Task<div id="ask"></div>
Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. We have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into **how consumers are using their smart devices**. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.

## Data Sources<div id="prepare"></div>
Sršen encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:
- [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

## Cleaning or manipulation of data<div id="process"></div>
Follow these steps:
1. Download the [the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
2. Unzip the files.
3. Create a folder on your desktop or Drive to house the files. Use appropriate file-naming conventions. If you need a refresher on file-naming conventions, you can revisit the [“All about file naming”]() video or the [“Organization guidelines”](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/supplement/fLKJI/organization-guidelines) reading.

4. We will deal with basic cleaning and manipulation of data like:
- Duplicate data
- Outdated data
- Incomplete data
- Incorrect/inaccurate data
- Inconsistence data

Here is the [Documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data]().

5. Proceed to the analyze step.

## Analyze
1. Import your data.
2. Explore your data, perhaps looking at the total number of rows, distinct values, maximum, minimum, or mean values.
3. Where relevant, use JOIN statements to combine your relevant data into different tables based upon the needs of your analyses.
4. Create summary statistics.
5. Investigate interesting trends and save that information to a table.
